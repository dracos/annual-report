    <h1>We threw a conference</h1>

    <p>More than 100 smart people from all over the world gathered at <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/research/tictec2015/">TICTeC 2015</a>, the world’s first conference on the impacts of civic technologies.</p>

    <aside><p>(Civic technology - that’s the proper name for what we do. And it’s really important to question whether it’s having the right kinds of impact.)</p></aside>

    <p>We’re already gearing up for <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/research/tictec-2016/">TICTeC 2016</a>.</p>

  <p>And unsurprisingly for a charity with a world-class research department,</p>
  <h1>We found a lot of stuff out</h1>

  <h2><span class="section--research--conjunction">Like…</span> It really makes a difference when governments respond to&nbsp;citizens</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2015/03/10/local-government-you-can-shape-your-own-responsible-citizens/">54% more difference, as it happens.</a> That’s how likely citizens are to carry on being engaged, provided they get a response the first time they make contact.</p>
  <aside class="interjection"><p>So listen up, all you councils!</p></aside>

<div class="section section--research--benefits">
  <h2><span class="section--research--conjunction">And…</span> Who exactly uses civic technology and&nbsp;why</h2>
  <p>Turns out it very much depends on which countries you are talking about. Here in the UK, we’re still fighting the “male, pale &amp; stale” effect. In Kenya and South Africa, however, it’s a completely different picture.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.mysociety.org/research/who-benefits-from-civic-technology/">Read the paper to find out why.</a></p>

<div class="section section--research--twfy">
  <h2><span class="section--research--conjunction">Plus…</span> TheyWorkForYou’s visitors are really driven by current events, and don’t want&nbsp;advice</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2015/11/04/understanding-theyworkforyous-users-without-the-power-of-mind-reading/">We studied more than 500,000 TheyWorkForYou visitors over 4 months, to better understand their needs.</a></p>
  <p>Jeremy Corbyn’s profile and voting record, for example, were viewed by thousands. Not many of them wanted our suggestions on what to do with the information they found.</p>
  <aside class="interjection"><p>Well, be like that, then!</p></aside>
