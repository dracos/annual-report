  <p>In the UK, we run four core sites, designed to help citizens…</p>

  <p><strong>TheyWorkForYou</strong>: Keep up to speed with what goes on in Parliament</p>
  <p><strong>WriteToThem</strong>: Send a message to elected representatives</p>
  <p><strong>WhatDoTheyKnow</strong>: Access information from publicly-funded bodies</p>
  <p><strong>FixMyStreet</strong>: Get things fixed in their own community</p>

  <h2>They’re pretty busy</h2>
  <p>and they make a difference to people’s lives</p>

  <p>That kept us busy!</p>

  <p>With other friendly organisations [LINK TO THEM] we set up <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2014/12/12/mysociety-endorses-yournextmp-lets-pull-together-to-make-a-free-trustworthy-open-database-of-general-election-candidates/">YourNextMP</a>, crowdsourcing information on every candidate for the General Election.</p>
  <p>We believe that information was the earliest, most complete dataset to be released.</p>
  <p>It was viewed by over a million people, looking for information about their voting choices.</p>
  <p>It included contact details and links to social media profiles and was even used by Google in the UK to power a tailored election search [LINK HERE].</p>
