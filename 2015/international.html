  <h2>Alaveteli</h2>
  <p>Our code for running a Freedom of Information website is now running in 25 jurisdictions around the world.</p>
  <p>Welcome ???????, ???????, ????????, ??????, and ???????.</p>
  <p>People who run Alaveteli sites have a lot to talk about. <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/alavetelicon-2015/">AlaveteliCon</a> in Madrid was a chance to do just that.</p>
  <p>And eat churros.</p>
  <p>Lots of churros.</p>

  <h2>Poplus</h2>
  <p>500 people around the world are members of the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus">Poplus community</a>.</p>
  <p>Its purpose?</p>
  <p>To <a href="http://poplus.org/components/current/">share civic technologies</a>, so nobody has to keep on reinventing the wheel.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h1>Some great things came out of Poplus this year…</h1>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>YourNextRepresentative</h2>
  <p>After helping to build the crowdsourcing platform YourNextMP for the UK General Election, we remodelled it for international use.</p>
  <p>It’s been busy <a href="http://investigacion.yoquierosaber.org/">collecting candidate data for Argentina</a> ahead of their own election.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>La Constitución De Todos</h2>
  <p>When Moroccans met Chileans at the first PoplusCon, they exemplified Poplus’ founding principles, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2015/07/02/la-constitucion-de-todos-how-morocco-shared-code-with-chile-via-poplus/">reusing Legislation Lab’s software</a> and enabling a countrywide discussion on the constitution for Chilean citizens.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>EveryPolitician</h2>
  <p>What do you need before you can build a site like <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou</a> or <a href="http://info.mzalendo.com/">Mzalendo</a>? Data. Lots of data.</p>
  <p>To be specific, politician data. In a nice, clean, usable format.</p>
  <p>That’s why we launched <a href="http://everypolitician.org/">EveryPolitician</a>, to store and share open, structured data on every politician in the world.</p>
  <p>Yes, that’s right, we said every politician in the world.</p>
  <p>Because what is life without a challenge?</p>
  <p>That challenge has been ably met by <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/about/team/tony-bowden/">Tony</a> and <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2015/09/15/everypolitician-200-countries-and-counting/">many volunteers</a>. There’s now data for ??? countries.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Gender Balance</h2>
  <p>EveryPolitician data can be used in all sorts of ways, by anyone. That’s the whole idea.</p>
  <p>But to show just one idea, we created <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2015/07/30/introducing-gender-balance-the-game-that-sorts-the-women-from-the-boys/">Gender Balance</a>.</p>
  <p>It’s a game. But it’s also doing something very useful.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.gender-balance.org/">Check it out!</a></p>
