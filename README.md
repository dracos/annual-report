# mySociety Annual Report

mySociety’s 2014 in numbers.

### How it works

The site is generated by Jekyll, into the `_site` directory. Sass styles are generated separately (see below).

We create pretty URLs using the `permalink:` feature in the YAML frontmatter of each page.

Each page represents a chapter of the report, and contains a handful of “sections” stacked vertically in the browser.

The height of these “sections”, and the width and height of the nav bar elements, is dependent on the height and width of the browser window.

### To run locally

You will need at least Sass v3.3 (to work with the `map` data type). Any recent
version of Jekyll will do, along with the Jekyll minibundle plugin. Use bundle,
or install them manually if you prefer.

```
bundle install --path vendor/bundle --binstubs vendor/bin
vendor/bin/sass --watch assets/sass:assets/css
vendor/bin/jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ''
```
