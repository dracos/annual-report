# mySociety Annual Report

mySociety’s 2014 in numbers.

### How it works

The site is generated by Jekyll, into the `_site` directory. Sass styles are generated separately (see below).

We create pretty URLs using the `permalink:` feature in the YAML frontmatter of each page.

Each page represents a chapter of the report, and contains 3–5 “sections” stacked vertically in the browser.

### To run locally

You will need at least Sass v3.3 (to work with the `map` data type). Any recent version of Jekyll will do.

```
sass --watch assets/sass:assets/css
```

```
jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ''
```
