<div class="section">
  <h1>We are mySociety</h1>
  <p>You might know us from our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/uk/">sites in the UK</a> like FixMyStreet, WhatDoTheyKnow, and TheyWorkForYou.</p>
  <p>Or you might have come across us in many countries <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/international/">around the world</a>.</p>
  <p>Maybe you’ve <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/alaveteli/">used our software</a> to set up your own site or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/poplus/">volunteered to make our code better</a>.</p>
  <p>Or perhaps you’ve <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/commercial/">contracted us</a> to build a web application for your organisation</a>.</p>
  <p>There are many sides to mySociety.</p>
  <p>Very few people know them all.</p>
  <p><strong>You are about to become one of the those people.</strong></p>
