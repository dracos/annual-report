    <h3>Orchestra</h3>
    <p>Our new conductor was only with us for the one year, but we covered quite a lot in a short period of time.</p>
    <p>February’s concert consisted of Sibelius’ <i>Karelia Suite</i>, Franck’s <i>Le Chasseur Maudit</i>, and Elgar’s <i>Prelude to The Dream of Gerontius</i> and <i>Enigma Variations</i>.
    In July, on the other hand, we had Wagner’s <i>Prelude to Tristan und Isolde</i>, and his <i>Wesendonck Lieder</i> (soloist Paula Sides), plus Bruckner’s Symphony No. 7.
    <p>We’re looking for string players; if you’re in the Birmingham area get in touch!

	As I had to look after a 2 year old on Monday, I had to get back from Vienna – over 1,000 miles – in a day, and I don’t get planes.
	I left on the 06:50 train from Vienna, missed my connection in Frankfurt due to an ambulance being called to someone on
	the train, rushed to Köln to pay extra for a Thalys train to get me to Brussels in time for the last Eurostar all ready to throw myself on their
	mercy, only to discover my booked Eurostar was still there, delayed due to the French elections. Home before midnight!
