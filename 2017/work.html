  <p class="lead">In 2017 I worked at mySociety three full days a week,
plus various nap times adding up to another day. Working remotely with
a small child is a boon for which I am very grateful.

  <p>My work this year included
adding paid subscriptions and spreadsheet data mapping to <a
href="https://mapit.mysociety.org">MapIt</a>, adding text verification to the
<a href="http://fixmystreet.org/">FixMyStreet Platform</a>,
and working closely with Oxfordshire County Council as they use
<a href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/pro/">FixMyStreet Pro</a> internally
(including offline support with appcache).
I’m also quite proud of getting FixMyStreet to 99%
on <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fixmystreet.com%2F&tab=mobile">Google Page Speed</a>.

      <p>FixMyStreet was ten this year, and also made its millionth report. I
wrote the original version (called Neighbourhood Fix-It for the first few
months), and I’m pleased that it has lasted this long, and for all that time has
had a slippy map that works just fine without JavaScript ;)

      <p>One tiny thing I wrote that I quite like was a GitHub commit status webhook, that checks
whether a pull request contains a changelog entry (and a migration if the schema
has changed).</p>

<h2>Phone numbers</h2>
<p>
One aspect of allowing text verification is we have to deal with phone numbers.
The UK has it pretty easy – all normal phone numbers start with 0, all mobile
numbers start 07, and so on.
The strangest country I found in my work was Argentina, where the international
mobile number +54 9 11 1234-5678 is the same as the national mobile number 011
15-1234-5678. Unless you’re texting that number from abroad when you should
probably drop the “9”…

<p>Google maintain a library, libphonenumber, which codifies every country’s
handling of telephone numbers as best it can; I assume this is inside Android
for dealing with the display of phone numbers everywhere. There is a Perl
library which uses that data for parsing/formatting, Number::Phone, which made
my job much easier. I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Number-Phone/pulls">number of pull requests</a> upstream, fixing some
bugs and adding some new features around the display of national numbers.  </p>
