      <h3>Family reunion, Dufton YHA</h3>
      <p>My dad is one of nine, so every couple of years we book an entire youth hostel or similar for a family reunion. This year
was in Dufton, in that area between the Lake District and the North Pennines. The youth hostel had a lovely treehouse ship, and
      lovely walks were had by all.

	<h3>Oxenford Gatehouse, Surrey</h3>
	<p>“Had a lovely weekend with some unseasonably warm and bright
	weather. Saturday was spent first at Waverley Abbey (wear waterproof shoes! We didn’t)
	and then gruffalo hunting at Alice Holt (think this was its final weekend), having to
	continually explain why we didn’t see any real gruffalos, plus brief trip to Devil’s
	Punch Bowl. Sunday, east to Leith Hill Tower &amp; Place (Tower opens first) and saw
	the sea! Then aborted trip to Polesden Lacey due to nap time, and to Hatchlands Park
	for the pianos and treehouse. Off home via Runnymede. Love the key &amp; the building.”

	<h3>The Wardrobe, Salisbury</h3>
	  <p>“A lovely weekend<sup>1</sup> high in the Close. We came here to visit the
	Terry Pratchett exhibition at Salisbury Museum, which was excellent,
	as was the rest of the museum. Also on Saturday we visited the market,
	saw ‘A Sea Symphony’ being rehearsed in the cathedral, and returned
	later for evensong. On Sunday, we caught the bus to Stonehenge (much
	changed since our last visit<sup>2</sup>) and then Old Sarum, both very interesting.
	Old Sarum has more up&amp;downs for a 2 year old, but the audio guide
	fascinated her round Stonehenge.
	<p>“The view over this desk while writing this is pretty good itself, if
	somewhat overshadowed by the front.
	<p><sup>1</sup> Apart from 4.30am awakenings.
	<p><sup>2</sup> Not the stones.”

      <h2>traintimes.org.uk</h2>
      <p>This year I made a number of performance improvements to my <a href="https://traintimes.org.uk/">unofficial
train times journey planner</a>, including a service worker for offline access,
HTTP/2, critical CSS inlining, and minimal JavaScript (dropping jQuery).
A results page is now c. 9KB cold, compared to 380KB for the official site.

    <h2>Slack Away Plus</h2>
    <p>After work moved from IRC to Slack earlier in the year, one thing I missed was being able to mark myself away and provide a reason at the same time.
    So I wrote a <code>/gone</code> command that can be used instead of <code>/away</code> to both mark yourself as away and set a status at the same time.
    For example, when off for lunch, you could enter <code>/gone :bread: Lunchtime</code> and then <code>/gone</code> when you're back.
