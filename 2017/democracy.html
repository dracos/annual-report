  <h2>Going Pro</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="column-two-thirds">
      <p>Our vision of a ‘Democratic Commons’ — where shared data benefits all — dovetailed neatly with Facebook’s drive to connect users with their representatives.</p>
      <p>In the UK, Kenya, France, Germany, Japan and Argentina, the day after their general elections while a tide of democratic engagement was still riding high, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2017/06/09/increasing-political-engagement-with-facebook/">Facebook users were invited to follow the people who represent them</a>. We were also able to use the information for our own project EveryPolitician.</p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote blockquote--smaller">“I enjoyed working on this project: it was great to think that so many people were encouraged to connect with their representatives as a result.” </blockquote>

        <p>EveryPolitician worked closely with the Wikidata community this year — that’s where Lucy and Luca came in. Since both EveryPolitician and Wikidata aspire to provide accurate, structured data that developers can use, it’s a great partnership.</p>

          <p>We supported Wikidata workshops in Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Nepal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden for Global Legislative Openness Week — and mySociety folk attended as many as possible to lend a helping hand. Tony gets a special shout-out for managing to visit workshops in 5 countries in just 8 days.</p>
          <p>GLOW is just one part of the picture, though: over the year we’ve worked with the Wikidata community to also ensure rich political data is available for the UK, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, Ireland, Australia, Pakistan, Germany, Estonia, France and the Netherlands and built new tools to make maintaining and adding that data quicker and easier.</p>

      <h2>Free speech in Iran</h2>
      <p>Working with the organisation Asl19, we helped launch a platform for Iranians to ask questions of their representatives — in public. In a culture of censorship and online surveillance, this was a <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2017/01/18/how-secrecy-helped-us-bring-about-transparency/">strike for transparency</a>.</p>

  <h2>Reaching those who need us most</h2>
  <p>A grant from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust enabled us to reach out to those sectors who might not know we exist, but could well need us the most - the young, the less well-off, and all types of minorities.</p>
  <p>With a video, leaflets send to schools in areas of highest deprivation, social media log-ins and topic pages added to TheyWorkForYou, we hope we’ve gone some way towards <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2017/09/28/new-to-us-media/">extending our outreach</a>.</p>
