  <h2>Going Pro</h2>
  <div class="row">

      <p>Our vision of a ‘Democratic Commons’, where shared data benefits all, coexisted neatly with our need for funding when we were able to provide information on electoral candidates both for our own EveryPolitician, and into Facebook’s drive to connect users with their representatives.</p>
      <p>In the UK, Kenya, France, Germany, Japan and Argentina, Facebook users were invited to follow the people who represent them, the day after their general elections while a tide of democratic engagement was still riding high</p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote blockquote--smaller">“I enjoyed working on this project: it was great to think that so many people were encouraged to connect with their representatives as a result.” </blockquote>

        <p>EveryPolitician worked closely with the Wikidata community this year — that’s where Lucy and Luca came in. Both projects aspire to provide accurate, structured data that developers can use, with EveryPolitician’s data fitting in well with Wikidata’s political knowledge base.</p>
        <p>We’ve worked with the Wikidata community to add rich political data for the UK, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, Pakistan, Germany, Estonia, France and the Netherlands and built new tools to make maintaining and adding that data quicker and easier.</p>

      <p>Working with the organisation Asl19, we helped launch a platform for Iranians to ask questions of their representatives — in public. In a culture of censorship and online surveillance, this was a <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2017/01/18/how-secrecy-helped-us-bring-about-transparency/">strike for transparency</a>.</p>

  <h2>Reaching those who need us most</h2>
  <p>A grant from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust enabled us to reach out to those sectors who might not know we exist, but could well need us the most - the young, the less well-off, and all types of minorities.</p>
  <p>With a video, leaflets send to schools in areas of highest deprivation, social media log-ins and topic pages added to TheyWorkForYou, we hope we’ve gone some way towards <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2017/09/28/new-to-us-media/">extending our outreach</a>.</p>

    <h2>A snap election</h2>
    <p>No-one expected the UK General Election! But when it came, we were really glad that we’d enabled social sharing on all the votes in TheyWorkForYou — in the weeks before the big vote, these were used heavily as people debated the pros and cons of their incumbent candidates.</p>

  <h2>Partner democracy sites</h2>
  <p><a href="http://www.shineyoureye.org/">ShineYourEye</a>, the parliamentary monitoring website for Nigeria, relaunched with a new homepage that mySociety developers helped to make a reality.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.pa.org.za/">People’s Assembly</a> has provided facts and oversight  through a rollercoaster year in politics for South Africa.</p>
  <p>In Kenya, political events were no less eventful: <a href="http://info.mzalendo.com/">Mzalendo</a> stood as a source of reliable information while the presidential election was annulled by the supreme court and then re-run. </p>

  <h2>Researchers for hire</h2>
  <p>Our research team visited Australia, Colombia, the Philippines and Tanzania as they undertook research for the Open Society Foundation on the extractives industry, and Mexico for the Hewlett Foundation and Omidyar Network on participatory budgeting. They also racked up <strong>15</strong> speaking engagements at conferences around the world as they spread the word about the research we undertake at mySociety.</p>
