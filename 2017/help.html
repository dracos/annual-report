  <p class="lead">We’ve achieved a lot in 2017. But we genuinely couldn’t do it without you. Funder, donor, volunteer, or one of our sites’ users — perhaps a mix of the above — whichever you are, you make it possible.</p>

  <p class="big-message-of-love"><strong>We want to say thank you. Because you’re amazing.</strong></p>

  <h3>To our fantastic funders</h3>
  <p>Thank you to the organisations who make our more ambitious projects possible — not just with grants, but often with invaluable advice, experience and support, too.</p>

    <p><strong>Omidyar Network</strong> and <strong>The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</strong>, for their support across everything we do.</p>

    <h3>To our loyal donors</h3>
    <p>Thank you. For the one-off contributions, for the regular payments. Everything helps.</p>
    <p>Your donations pay for all sorts of things that keep mySociety going — and while our office-free existence keeps overheads low, there are some costs we’ll always face.</p>
    <p>You help us cover the big stuff like keeping our servers going, and the small stuff like going to speak to the people who need our services… and plenty more in between.</p>

      <p>When you drop us a line to let us know that one of our sites has helped with a problem, or made something easier, we always share your words with the team. It cheers us up no end!</p>

    <h2>And off we go, into 2018…</h2>
    <p>We’ve got big plans for next year, too:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>You’ll see us step up on the Democratic Commons, working with partners to bring benefits to all;</li>
     <li>We’ll be reaching out more to the people who need us most, but who don’t yet know that our services exist;</li>
     <li>We hope to support journalists and campaign groups as Alaveteli Professional blossoms;</li>
     <li>We’ll continue to listen to councils about their needs, and feed that back into FixMyStreet Pro;</li>
     <li>And to help it all happen, we’ll be seeking out new models and sources of funding (know someone we should talk to? <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/contact/">Drop us a line!</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We hope you’ll be with us every step of the way.</p>
