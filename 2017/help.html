  <p class="lead">We’ve achieved a lot in 2017. But we genuinely couldn’t do it without you. Funder, donor, volunteer, or one of our sites’ users — perhaps a mix of the above — whichever you are, you make it possible.</p>
  <p><strong>We want to say thank you. Because you’re amazing.</strong></p>
  <h3>To our fantastic funders</h3>
  <p>Thank you to the organisations who make our more ambitious projects possible — not just with grants, but often with invaluable advice, experience and support, too.</p>

  <p>Omidyar Network and The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, for their support across everything we do.</p>

  <p>The David & Elaine Potter Foundation for their contribution to our core funding.</p>

  <p>The Google Digital News Initiative for giving us the time and resources to develop Alaveteli Professional.</p>

  <p>The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust for funding our outreach to younger users on TheyWorkForYou.</p>

  <p>The Wikimedia Foundation for making possible the collaboration between Wikidata and EveryPolitician.</p>

  <p>The Indigo Trust, also for helping to support the EveryPolitician/Wikidata project, and for continuing funding of the parliamentary monitoring sites our partners in Africa run.</p>

  <p>Power to Change for funding work on an Assets of Community Value tool.</p>

  <p>Google.org, Open Culture Foundation Taiwan and the MacArthur Foundation for sponsoring TICTeC, the Impacts of Civic Technologies conference.</p>

  <p>Would you like to be a sponsor for TICTeC 2018? See the benefits here.</p>

  <h3>To our loyal donors</h3>
  <p>Thank you. For the one-off contributions, for the regular payments. Everything helps.</p>
  <p>Your donations pay for all sorts of things that keep mySociety going — and while our office-free existence keeps overheads low, there are some costs we’ll always face.</p>
  <p>You help us cover the big stuff like keeping our servers going, and the small stuff like going to speak to the people who need our services… and plenty more in between.</p>

  <p>Help us continue to provide technology that makes a difference, in the UK and around the world: become a mySociety donor now.</p>

  <h3>To our diligent volunteers</h3>
  <p>Thank you to the small team that steers the policy on WhatDoTheyKnow, moderates the content and makes sure we stay on the right side of the law — and helps thousands of users when they have questions or problems.</p>

  <h3>To our extraordinary partners</h3>
  <p>Thank you to the motivated, passionate and principled people who run sites based on our code. Thanks for being so generous with your time and your insights, and for being part of a worldwide community of people trying to make the world better through civic technologies.</p>

  <h3>To visitors like you</h3>
  <p>Thank you for using our sites, for spreading the word to friends, family and colleagues, and for keeping up with our news through the blog and newsletters.</p>

  <p>There’s only one reason we go to all the bother of making the tools we do — because people like you use them.</p>

  <p>When you drop us a line to let us know that one of our sites has helped with a problem, or made something easier, we always share your words with the team. It cheers us up no end!</p>
