  <h1>2016 in figures</h1>
  <p>26 human beings and one bot, crunching hundreds of thousands of lines of code and working with scores of organisations around the world. It’s not <em>all</em> about the numbers, but they do give a good overview.</p>

        Every time we press the button marked ‘commit’, we’re making changes and additions to our code. This figure’s wildly up on last year’s (15,723) because of the diligent little EveryPolitician Bot. Find out more about that later.

  <p>We’re so glad to see the concept of civic technology spreading and doing good all over the world, and we wish we could work with every single one of the organisations who applied for our development help. Sadly, there are only so many hours in the day and only so many developers in mySociety: but until that changes, our vibrant <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/subscribe/">online communities and message groups</a> are there to give you support online.</p>

  <p>This year, we <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/23752">evaluated citizen engagement</a> and <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2016/02/19/our-latest-research-citizen-engagement-in-new-zealand-and-australia/">investigated civic initiatives in New Zealand and Australia</a>. But we also conducted targeted research in FOI, Democracy, and Better Cities - and that’s also in the sections below.</p>
