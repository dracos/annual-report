  <h1>Better Cities</h1>
  <p>FixMyStreet helps citizens <strong>report problems in their community</strong> to the authorities responsible for getting them fixed.</p>
  <p>But it’s also a whole lot more: a CRM for councils, for starters. And FixMyStreet’s extreme flexibility means that it’s been used for all kinds of projects, from <strong>cycle accident reporting</strong> to <strong>corruption-busting</strong>.</p>
