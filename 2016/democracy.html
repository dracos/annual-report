  <h1>Democracy</h1>
  <p>We help people in 12 countries run democracy sites that keep an eye on their parliaments. Meanwhile, here in the UK, we run <strong>TheyWorkForYou</strong> and <strong>WriteToThem</strong>.</p>
  <p>But this year we’ve also been working on a massive initiative: the <strong>EveryPolitician</strong> project collects and shares data on politicians around the world so that anyone, anywhere, can use it for their own parliamentary monitoring site… or any other project.</p>
