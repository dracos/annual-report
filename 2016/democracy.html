  <h1>Democracy</h1>
  <p>We help people in 12 countries run democracy sites: sites that keep an eye on their parliaments, publish out debates and votes, match constituents with their representatives, and show information about candidates where there are elections.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, here in the UK, we run two useful democracy sites: TheyWorkForYou, for keeping an eye on your elected representatives, and WriteToThem for letting them know how you feel about their activity.</p>
  <p>But this year we’ve also been working on a massive initiative: the EveryPolitician project collects and shares data on politicians around the world so that anyone, anywhere, can use it for their own parliamentary monitoring site… or any other project.</p>
